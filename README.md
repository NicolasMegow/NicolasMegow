# Hi, I'm Nicolas 👋

## I'm a coach.

I have a knack for spurring self-discovery and increasing self-efficacy in others.
Also it makes me very happy to see other people discover their potential.
Been coaching for 10+ years now (yes, I started at age 20...).

## I'm a model thinker.

My brain works in simple models of complex situations.
I like sketching, Lego Serious Play and management accounting to help me see the patterns in systems.

## And I'm an elephant.

I slowly pick up momentum. That's why I start early and persevere to get results.
